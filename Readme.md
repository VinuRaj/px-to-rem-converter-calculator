# PX to REM converter / PX to REM calculator

A simple calculator that converts PX to REM (pixel to root em) with the base font size of 16px or 16 pixels _(but can be changed based on your CSS requirements).

As a designer or front end developer, we use px (pixel) and rem (root em) as a relative unit of CSS to measure the length of screen media or screens or displays on various devices.

#### PX to REM calculation formula
  
You could also use the formula `rem = px/base font size` to manually calculate or convert PX to REM.
  
#### Stack used

- Tailwind CSS (the utility-first _CSS_ framework that allowed me to build this micro-website without even leaving my HTML)
